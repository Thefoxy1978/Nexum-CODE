# Nexum-CODE

"Development Challenges"

The primary challenge in creating Nexum was designing a fluid character-switching system. Given that this was my first time implementing such a mechanic, it required extensive iteration to achieve smooth transitions and responsive controls between the two playable characters. Ensuring that the switch feels natural and maintains gameplay continuity was essential to the puzzle-solving experience.

"Key Focus Areas"

A significant amount of development effort went into:

Player Controller Design: I created a custom player controller system to manage the controls, interactions, and unique behaviors of both characters. Each character is designed to be distinct yet consistent, enhancing the gameplay experience while preserving responsiveness and ease of control during character switching.
